# Processing with Kotlin

This project grows out of my desire to learn Kotlin and Processing
simultaneously. It is also an experiment to gain access to Processing's core
library (all those [graphics functions](https://processing.org/reference/))
without using its IDE. As it turned out, Processing and Kotlin can work together
quite seamlessly.

All programs are small and stand-alone. You need **Java 8** and **Gradle 4.4**
to build them:

- `gradle classes` to compile
- `gradle run` to see it
